## What is Navicat Premium?

Navicat Premium is a professional database management solution that lets you connect to multiple databases in a single app. It supports MySQL, MariaDB, MongoDB, SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and SQLite, making cross-database administration and data transfer simple.

It’s designed for DBAs, developers, data analysts, and anyone who needs a unified toolkit to design schemas, write SQL, automate maintenance, migrate data, and visualize insights. Navicat’s polished UI and powerful wizards make complex routines (like cross-engine migration or incremental synchronization) approachable and repeatable.

### Key Features
- Connect to multiple databases at once in one UI.  
- Visual query builder and powerful SQL editor.  
- Data transfer, import/export, and synchronization.  
- Backup/restore and scheduled automation.  
- Charts, reporting, and data visualization.  
- Cross-platform: Windows, macOS, and Linux.

---

## Common Use Cases

- **Multi-DB Administration**: Manage multiple engines and environments (dev/stage/prod) side-by-side.  
- **Data Migration**: Move data between engines (e.g., MySQL → PostgreSQL) with mapping rules and verification.  
- **Team Development**: Compare/synchronize schemas, track changes, and standardize environments.  
- **Data Pipelines**: Import CSV/Excel/JSON, transform with queries, export to formats needed by BI tools.

## Quick Start: First Connection (5 Minutes)

1. **Open Navicat Premium** → **Connection** → choose your DB engine.  
2. Enter **Host**, **Port**, **User**, **Password**, and (if needed) **Database**.  
3. Click **Test Connection** to validate access (enable **SSH**/**SSL** if your server requires it).  
4. Save the connection; double-click to open the object explorer.  
5. Right-click a schema/database to **Create Table**, **Design**, or **Open Query**.  
6. Press **Run** (`⌘R` on macOS / `Ctrl+R` on Windows/Linux) to execute scripts and preview results.

---

## Data Transfer & Synchronization (Step-by-Step)

1. **Tools → Data Transfer**: Choose **Source** and **Target** connections.  
2. Select **Objects** (tables, views, procedures) and set **Mappings** (rename, change data types).  
3. Choose **Transfer Options** (truncate target, copy structure only, copy data, batch size).  
4. **Preview SQL** (optional) to verify generated DDL/DML.  
5. **Run** or **Schedule** (see Automation below).  

For **Schema Sync** (structure only):  
- **Tools → Structure Synchronization** → Compare two schemas → Review differences → Generate/Run synchronization script.

---

## Import/Export Wizard

- **Import** CSV/TSV, Excel, JSON, XML into existing or new tables. Use field mapping and data type inference.  
- **Export** results or whole tables to CSV/Excel/JSON/SQL dumps.  
- **Transform** using SQL views before exporting to keep raw data intact.

> Pro tip: Save your import/export profiles so recurring data drops become one-click operations or scheduled tasks.

---

## Visual SQL Builder & Editor

- **Visual Builder**: Drag tables into the canvas, create joins, filters, and aggregations—Navicat generates the SQL.  
- **Smart Editor**: Syntax highlighting, code folding, snippets, parameter prompts, and explain plans.  
- **Templates**: Keep reusable snippets for common audits (missing indexes, long-running queries, etc.).  
- **Explain/Analyze**: Inspect execution plans and timing to tune queries.

---

## Object Designer

- **Tables**: Define columns, constraints (PK/FK/Unique/Check), defaults, and comments.  
- **Views**: Build from queries or the visual builder.  
- **Routines**: Create/edit **Functions** and **Stored Procedures** with validation.  
- **Triggers & Events**: Manage automation at the database level.  
- **Users & Roles**: Grant privileges and review effective permissions.

---

## Charts, Reports, and Exploration

- Run a query, then switch to **Chart** to create interactive visuals (line, bar, pie, area, etc.).  
- **Save** charts with their underlying SQL so collaborators understand the logic.  
- Export charts as images or data as CSV for BI tools.

---

## Automation & Scheduling

- Turn any transfer, export, or sync routine into a **Job**.  
- **Schedule** jobs (hourly, daily, weekly, custom CRON-like frequencies).  
- Configure **Notifications** (e.g., email) on success/failure.  
- **Logs** provide historical runs, duration, and error messages for debugging.

---

## Security & Connectivity

- **SSH Tunnel**: Securely connect to servers behind firewalls; no public DB port required.  
- **SSL/TLS**: Use certificates/CA bundles to encrypt connections to managed services.  
- **Role-Based Access**: Follow least-privilege principles when creating DB users.  
- **Secrets Hygiene**: Store credentials securely; rotate passwords/keys regularly.

> Note: Always comply with your organization’s security policy and regulatory requirements.

---

## Performance Tuning Basics

- **Indexing**: Create composite indexes for frequent filter/sort patterns; avoid over-indexing.  
- **Query Review**: Use `EXPLAIN` to spot full scans and missing indexes.  
- **Partitioning**: Consider table partitioning for large time-series data.  
- **Connection Pooling**: Ensure the server is tuned for expected concurrent connections.  
- **Archival**: Move cold/old data to cheaper storage to keep OLTP sets lean.

---

## Team Workflow Tips

- **Naming Conventions**: Establish consistent names for tables, columns, and constraints.  
- **Migration Scripts**: Keep DDL in version control (Git) alongside application code.  
- **Dev/Staging/Prod**: Use separate connections and color-coded tabs to prevent mistakes.  
- **Templates**: Share Navicat templates/profiles for imports, exports, and diagnostics.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Can’t Connect?**  
  - Verify host/port/firewall/VPN.  
  - Test with `ping`/`telnet`/`nc` locally.  
  - Check server logs and authentication method (password, IAM auth, Kerberos, etc.).
- **SSL Errors**  
  - Confirm certificate validity, chain, and server compatibility.  
  - Match cipher suites and protocol versions supported by your DB service.
- **Slow Queries**  
  - Check `EXPLAIN`, add needed indexes, reduce result set size, paginate.  
  - Review network latency and server resource usage (CPU, RAM, I/O).
- **Schema Drift**  
  - Use **Structure Synchronization** and enforce migrations via jobs.

---

## Shortcuts (macOS Defaults)

- **Run Query**: `⌘R`  
- **Format SQL**: `⌥⌘L`  
- **Find in Editor**: `⌘F`  
- **Toggle Result/Editor**: `⌘1 / ⌘2`  
- **New Query**: `⌘N`  
- **Stop Execution**: `⌘.`

*(On Windows/Linux, use `Ctrl` variants.)*
